# LLM Tool Client Architecture

## 1. Overall Architecture

### Goal
A client for LLMs that supports a wide array of "tools" (APIs, system utilities, databases, etc.). The client should provide:

* A flexible, type-safe interface for tool developers
* A rich user interface that supports multiline input, syntax highlighting, and so on
* Plugin-style extensibility for adding new tools

### Key Decisions
* Terminal-based UI using `prompt_toolkit` (and optionally `rich`) for a more user-friendly experience in the terminal
* Pydantic-based data models for tool input parameters, providing automatic validation and schema generation
* Custom Tool Protocol, rather than something specialized like MCP (Model Context Protocol), because we need the interface to handle a broad range of tool types, not just LLM or chat-focused calls

## 2. Interface (TUI) Review

### Rationale
A TUI avoids the complexity of a full web-based React or Vue UI but is still more capable than a basic command-line parser.

### Benefits
* Better multiline input handling
* History navigation
* Syntax highlighting for code
* Potential for structured prompts (like forms, dialogues, etc.)

### Potential Pitfalls
* More advanced TUI frameworks do have learning curves
* In some environments, rich TUIs might fail gracefully (e.g., remote servers with limited terminal support)
* If you need wide adoption by non-technical users, a web-based UI could eventually be considered

## 3. Tooling Architecture & Pydantic

### Tool Classes
* Use Pydantic BaseModel to define each tool's parameters
* Ensures that each tool's input is strongly validated (e.g., types, required fields, permissible values)

### Schema Generation
* `tool.parameters_class.schema()` or `BaseModel.schema()` can auto-generate JSON Schemas for documentation or UI hinting

### Async-First Execution
* Tools may require network calls, parallel queries, or CPU-bound tasks
* Adopting an async interface allows concurrency without blocking the main thread

### Health Checks & Registration
* A registry holds references to available tools
* Tools can be checked for availability (e.g., can the API be reached?) before being used or registered

### Custom Protocol
* A single abstract base class (ToolProtocol) with well-defined methods (`execute`, `validate`, `health_check`, etc.)
* Ensures every tool "speaks the same language," even if they do drastically different tasks under the hood

## 4. Example Tool Implementation

### WebAPITool
* Demonstrates how you might handle REST API calls within this framework
* Showcases an execute method that uses an async HTTP client
* Illustrates Pydantic-based parameters (e.g., url, method, headers, body, etc.)
* Highlights best practices like merging default headers with any user-provided headers
* Includes a validate method to check correctness of the URL format
* Features health_check to quickly verify the endpoint or base URL is reachable

This example can be generalized to other tools (like a database query tool, file manipulations, or local shell commands).

## 5. Additional Recommendations & Next Steps

### Tool Discovery & Loading
* Use Python's entry points or simple Python import scanning to automatically discover tools in a given directory or package
* Possibly maintain a simple manifest or config file for specifying available tools

### Tool Composition / Chaining
* Consider a lightweight orchestration layer to chain tool outputs into subsequent tool inputs
* Example: a tool that fetches data from an API, then pipes it into a tool that processes or visualizes it

### Security Considerations
* If some tools allow shell commands or file modifications, consider sandboxing or role-based permission checks
* For network tools, guard against SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) and rate limiting if publicly exposed

### Error Handling & Logging
* Provide robust error handling (including typed exceptions) in each tool
* Consider structured logging (e.g., using Python's logging library or external frameworks)
* Integrate with the UI for user-friendly error messages

### Documentation & Testing
* Each tool's Pydantic model can produce a JSON schema for documentation
* Automate that into a docs site or in-tool help system
* Write unit tests for each tool's execute and validate methods
* Mock external dependencies (network, file system) for more reliable tests

### Performance & Scalability
* For higher concurrency, investigate whether your concurrency model (e.g., asyncio) plus the I/O patterns of each tool is sufficient
* Consider thread or process pools if CPU-bound tasks are significant

### Extend to External Interfaces (Optional)
* If you plan to expose these tools through an HTTP server or gRPC, design a server component that loads the same registry and calls execute with request data
* This would let you scale usage beyond a local TUI

## Conclusion

### Pros of This Approach
* Unified but flexible interface for all tools
* Strong typing and validation through Pydantic
* Rich, user-friendly TUI without web overhead
* Async-first design to handle many types of operations
* Straightforward plugin/registry pattern

### Key Takeaways
* The plan effectively balances flexibility (by allowing many tool types) with consistency (by requiring the same protocol and Pydantic-based parameters)
* The TUI approach covers many real-world dev use cases while still leaving the door open to a future web-based interface if user demands grow
* Focusing on health checks, error handling, documentation, and testing upfront helps ensure the system will be maintainable and production-ready
* Overall, the plan is well-structured and should be robust enough to accommodate a wide variety of tools and future expansions
